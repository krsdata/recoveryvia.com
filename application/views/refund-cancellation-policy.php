                                      <li>The products available for purchase on our web site are downloadable, functional, and try-before-you-buy. We provide free trial periods to let you fully evaluate our products before you make a purchase decision.</li>
                                      <li>Please use the trial period to make sure that the software meets your needs before purchasing a license. All of our software is functional during the trial period. None of our software requires registration to enable its primary functionality.</li>
                                      <li>If you purchase one of our products, after your payment has cleared your license to use the software will be activated. Once the license is activated, no refunds will be given. We have this policy since it would be impossible for you to return your registered version of our software.</li>
                                      <li>During your trial period, our support staff is available to assist in installation and configuration via email or telephone. We strongly recommend that all customers download, install, and test the trial version of any product prior to making a purchase.</li>
                                      <li>In rare instances and only within 30 days of purchase, if due to technical difficulties or platform incompatibilities the software will not function, we may, at our discretion, issue a refund. In such instances, we require that you provide enough information for us to positively identify your purchase transaction (e.g., order number, your company name, date of transaction, purchase code, number of licenses purchased, etc.). If we are able to positively identify your order, and if your request is made within 30 days of purchase, you must submit to us a email or letter of destruction of on-premise software on your company letterhead or company email before we will process the refund. Avankia is not responsible for lost, delayed, or misdirected mail or email, delays for downloading, or other communication system delays.</li>
                                      <li><b>Acceptance of this Refund Policy</b> <br>
It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with this refund policy. By placing an order for any of our products, you indicate that you have read this refund policy and that you agree with and fully accept the terms of this refund policy.
If you do not agree with or fully accept the terms of this refund policy, we ask that you do not place an order with us.
