                                 <b> INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE / RISK WARNING</b> <br>
Past performance is not indicative of future performance. The value of investments can fall as well as rise and investors may not get back the amount originally invested. An investment in a currency other than the investor's own base currency will be subject to the movement of foreign exchange rates which may cause an additional favourable or unfavourable change in the value of investment. Interest rates, market conditions, special offers, tax rulings and other investment factors are subject to sometimes rapid change.
